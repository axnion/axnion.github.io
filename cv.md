### About
My name is Axel Nilsson, born May 22, 1994 in Sweden. I'm currently living in Jonstorp, Sweden while studying remotely at Linnaeus University. When I'm not studying I like to relax and listen to podcasts, play games, or work on one of my side projects. I also have a passion for music, playing guitar, bass, drums, and singing throughout my teenage years. I still do a bit of sound engineering in my home studio while trying to learn to play the piano.
